# Comprehensive-Sales-and-HR-Analytics-for-Jet-Ski-World--PowerBI
Project Name: Comprehensive Sales and HR Analytics for Jet-Ski World

Objective: The primary goal of this project was to empower Jet-Ski World with data-driven insights for strategic decision-making in sales optimization and human resource management.

Project Overview: In this project, I developed two robust PowerBI reports aimed at dissecting complex data into actionable insights for Jet-Ski World, a leading jet ski company.

Data Gathering and Import

The first step is gathering relevant data and business requirements. For this project, we will use sample sales data for a fictional company JetSKi World provided in Excel, text and PDF formats.
We import the data by selecting the appropriate file type and loading the tables. This gives us a connected dataset to work with in Power BI.

Data Transformation

With the raw data imported, we now clean and transform it to prepare for analysis. Key steps include:
•	Renaming tables for clarity
•	Removing unnecessary rows
•	Promoting headers
•	Unpivoting columns
•	Splitting columns like name into first and last
•	Merging columns like first and last name
•	Replacing text values
•	Changing data types
•	Filtering out unused data

These transformations shape the data into an optimal form for visualization.

Data Modeling

Next, we build relationships between the tables to create a star schema model. The core Fact table is the Sales table, which connects to supporting Dimension tables like Category, Product, and Distributor.
We also create new calculated columns and measures using DAX to derive additional insights. Examples are a Total Cost column and Sales Growth measure.

Visualization and Reporting

Sales Analysis Report:

•	Forecasting: Utilized predictive analytics to forecast sales trends, enabling proactive business planning for the upcoming years.

•	Growth Analysis: Mapped out sales growth trajectories, highlighting areas of success and opportunities for expansion.
•	Geographic Performance: Analyzed sales performance across different cities and states to identify high-performing regions.

•	Distributor Insights: Identified top distributors contributing to the company’s revenue, providing a basis for strengthening partnerships

HR Management Report:

•	Employee Demographics: Presented a comprehensive overview of the workforce, including headcount and departmental breakdowns.
•	Job Satisfaction: Developed an interactive job satisfaction chart to gauge employee morale and pinpoint areas for improvement.
•	Promotion Tracking: Created a visual promotion chart to monitor career progression within the company, fostering a culture of growth and recognition

Publishing and Sharing

Once the reports are finished, we publish them to Power BI cloud service. This allows sharing interactive dashboards via links and enables data refresh.
The published reports can also be embedded into PowerPoint or exported to PDFs. A dashboard combines visuals from both reports into a single view.
Key Benefits
•	Interactive visualization uncovers data insights
•	Modeling enhances analysis
•	Powerful DAX calculations
•	Flexible publishing and sharing
•	Real-time data refresh
•	Mobile-friendly dashboards

Purpose: The purpose of these reports was not only to present current data but also to predict future trends and provide Jet-Ski World with a competitive edge through informed decision-making. The sales report aimed at maximizing revenue through strategic market analysis, while the HR report focused on optimizing employee satisfaction and retention.

Impact: These reports have been instrumental in shaping Jet-Ski World’s strategic initiatives, leading to enhanced operational efficiency and improved employee engagement.
